h1. Install introduction

A _very_ short introduction on how to install spray and run the example.

# Install Eclipse Indigo classic IDE.
# Install new software
** EMF, Xtext2, MWE2, GEF, Graphiti
# Import all plugins from the plugins and from the examples directories fro the respository
# In the example project, look into the 'model' directory.
** you need to change the path in the spray file and the properties file to freflect your situation.
# Run org.xspray.xtext.generator.Main with the full pathname of the spray model file as the only argument as a file URI, like file://C:/xspray/xspray-runtime/org.xspray.examples.one/model/mod4j-busmod.xspray]
# This should generate the code in the location described in the .properties file
** refresh this project and start a new Eclipse]
** in this eclipse create a project and the a new ==> Example ==> Graphiti Diagram ==> Mode4j
  
Note that I have only run this on my machine with fixed paths,  so you might encounter some problems doing the above
