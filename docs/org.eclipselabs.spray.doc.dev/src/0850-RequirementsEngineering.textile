h1. Requirements Engineering

Additional to the issue tracking we started to manage end user level requirements / use cases with an extra tool: "Yakindu requirements":http://www.yakindu.com/requirements/

The sources of the requirements specification is checked in on the GIT branch "yakindu_requirements"

With Yakindu requirements we can describe requirements, use cases, entities, UI forms, UI flows and state transitions with Xtext based integrated DSLs. There is provided a live graphical preview of the use case flows.

Out of this models you can generate HTML and PDF requirements specification reports as well as a work break down structure Excel sheet.

Please note that the Spray requirements specification is currently in a very early stage (only rudimentary use cases, entities models just transformed from the existing Ecores and so too technical for a user centered view).

The latest generated PDF requirements specification report can be downloaded from "here":http://spray.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/git-history/yakindu_requirements/docs/org.eclipselabs.spray.doc.requirements/output/specconfig/SprayReport/SprayReport.pdf
