h1. Setting up the developer environment

h2. Source Control
 
We are using Git as source management system. The primary repository location is: "https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/":https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/

See "http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/source/checkout":http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/source/checkout for details.

You can new clone Git from the command line or use Eclipse, which is explained in a later section of this guide.

h3. Manual Feature Installation

If you wish to install the Spray IDE features onto your existing Eclipse installation, configure the required update sites and install the features mentioned above. The update sites used to install the features required to develop Spray can be imported in your IDE. As a base take any Eclipse 4.x distribution. Then open workspace preferences _Install / Update -> Available Software Site_ and click the _Import_ button. When you already cloned the Spray repository, then choose the file

bc. <path to your locally cloned Spray Git repository>/org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv/updatesites-spray-dev.xml

otherwise import the file from the CI server: 

bc. https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-ci-build/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/devtools/org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv/updatesites-spray-dev.xml

This XML file will add all required update sites to visit later when installing the plug-ins for the development environment. 

Now install the features with the Eclipse Update Manager (_Help -> Install New Software_).

h3. Installing through P2 director launch config

For convenience there is a launch config @install-devenv-4.2.launch@ in project org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv. Right-click this launch config, then choose _Run As / install-devenv-4.2_. Choose the base directory of your Eclipse 4.2 installation. You must not start the config from the Eclipse instance you want to update, take any other Eclipse.

h3. Troubleshooting

If you have already installed one of the above mentioned features you might experience problems installing the newer features. In this case uninstall the features in question before (Eclipse / About Eclipse / Installation Details / Installed Software -> Uninstall).

For example, if you need to upgrade Xtext, uninstall *all* Xtext features, and the install Xtext SDK again with Install New Software.

h2. Workspace Setup

h3. Target Platform

For plugin development it is important to work against a fixed set of plugins. While the IDE provides a good default, since it is build from the defined features in the required versions, the actual target platform may differ slightly.

Spray maintains two Target Definitions (@.target@ files), which can be found in the @releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.targetplatform@ project:

* @spray-<EclipseMainRelease>.target@: (@<EclipseMainRelease> currently is @kepler@) Defines the target platform against the remote repositories where the required features are hosted. While it should it perfectly valid to use this target definition, it takes more time to resolve the plugins from the repositories. Also this target definition might break when the referenced repositories do not contain the listed feature versions anymore. This happens with features that are build frequently. Especially when the main Eclipse release is close the target changes often. 
* @spray-ci.target@: _(Recommended)_ Using the target definition mentioned above Spray builds a dedicated target platform repository on the Cloudbees Jenkins server. This repository stays consistent until the repository is rebuild using an updated target. For developers it is usually the right Target Platform to use.

Open the preferences and set "Spray CI Target" in _Plug-in Development / Target Platform_.

h3. Team Project Set

You can use our predefined team project set file to get the Spray projects into your workspace. This will automatically clone the Git repository and mport the projects.

* File > Import... > Team/Team Project Set, Next
* URL: "@http://spray.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/git/devtools/org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv/projectSet.psf@":http://spray.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/git/devtools/org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv/projectSet.psf, Finish 

When creating a new workspace make sure to set the following settings:

h3. Initial Build

When the projects are checked out initially, several projects will not be compilable. This is because the projects require generated sources, which are not checked in. To trigger the generation we make a full build. Run the launch configuration @releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.distribution/launch/spray build default.launch@ or on the command line in project @org.eclipselabs.spray.distribution@ call "@mvn clean install -s settings.xml@".

h3. Workspace Preferences

The Workspace Mechanic is a useful tool to manage common preferences for setting up workspaces. It basically scans configured directories for preference files (@*.epf@). These settings are provided in the @org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv@ project.

To configure the settings directory open the Workspace Preferences and go to Workspace Mechanic. On the preference page, add a new task source. Take the absolute path to the @org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv/preferences@ directory.

!images/mechanic-1.png! 

After closing the preferences dialog the Workspace Mechanic will scan the configuration from the devenv directory. A hover dialog will pop up in the bottom right corner and remind to you to fix the workspace setup. 

!images/mechanic-3.png! 

Click on "View and correct configuration issues" and fix the setup.
 
In @org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv@ there is a Java formatter configuration @formatter.xml@ used in this project.
Apply this formatter before committing anything.

h3. Add Spray task repository to Eclipse 

* Window > Show View > Other... > Mylyn/Task Repositories
* Open context menu in Task Repositories view > Add task repositories...
* Google Code, Next
** URL: Paste "@http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/@":http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/
** Label: Spray
** unselect Anonymous, if you later want to push code
** enter your Google Account credentials (now use as password your Google Mail password, not the Google Code Password), Finish
!images/mylyn_1.png!
* Add New Query
* use predefined query > Open issues
!images/mylyn_2.png!
* Window > Show View > Other... > Mylyn/Task List

h3. Add Spray Jenkins connector to Eclipse 

* Window > Show View > Other... > Mylyn/Builds
* Click on the first of the icons in the right of the view header > Hudson (supports Jenkins), Next
** Server: "https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com":https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com
** Label: Spray
** select Anonymous
** click on Refresh button
** select job "spray-ci-build"
** Finish
* click on spray-ci-build to show the current job status 

h3. Add Spray Git repository to Eclipse 


This will clone the Spray repository into your Eclipse workspace folder, create a number of working sets and add the projects to the working sets. To see the working sets go to the "View menu" icon of the Package Explorer and select Working Sets as Top Level Elements.

If you want to specify the location where to clone the Spray repository locally do the following:   
* File > Git/Projects from Git
* Add
* <Path to your locally cloned Git repository>, Next
* Search, OK

If you had cloned the Spray repository locally and want to use that repository:   
* File > Git/Projects from Git
* Clone
* Paste https://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/ in the URI field and add your Google Account user name and your GoogleCode.com password (if your are logged in at the Spray Google Code site, click the Profiles link in the upper right corner and then go to the Settings tab) , Next
* select all branches, Next
* select your local path to store the Git repository clone, Finish

If you want to apply the Spray workset configuration without being forced to clone the Spray repository again, you can copy devtools/org.eclipselabs.spray.devenv/workingsets.xml to </path/to/workspace/.metadata>/.plugins/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/workingsets.xml


h2. Target Platform
 
We are targeting for Eclipse Indigo. A "target platform definition":http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/concepts/target.htm 
is provided in @releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.targetplatform/spray.target@. To set this target platform:
* Import the project from path @releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.targetplatform@
* Open Workspace properties, go to _Plug-in Development / Target Platform_
* Here you should see _Spray Target Platform_. Check it and press _Apply_.
** As alternative you can also use the locally built target platform by Add... -> Nothing -> Name: Local Spray Target, Add... -> Directory, Next -> Location: <your local path to the cloned Spray git repository>/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.repository/target/repository.
