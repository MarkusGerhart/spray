h2. Postprocessed generated Ecore Metamodels

To avoid serialization problems it is sometimes needed to change the default values of attributes, or the Serializer might not distuinguish a not set value from a value that matches the default value (e.g. 0.0 for a double). If the metamodel is inferred there might be the need to postprocess the inferred metamodel and adjust it. This is done by an implementation of @IXtext2EcorePostProcessor@. The Generator component of the language must use the postprocessor implementation. Due to Maven the specialized Generator component and the postprocessor must be in a separate dependent module, since the classes must be compiled before they can be used from the workflow. Therefore these classes reside in the @org.eclipselabs.spray.runtime.xtext@ plugin.
