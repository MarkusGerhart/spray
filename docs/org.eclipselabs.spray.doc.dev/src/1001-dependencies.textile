h2. Dependencies

How to manage dependencies.

h2. Update Maven plugin versions

Go to directory @releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.distribution@ and "check for plugin updates":http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/examples/display-plugin-updates.html :

bc.. 
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates
p. 
When the report shows some plugin updates or non-configured versions then change this in the parent POM @releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.parent/pom.xml@.

h2. Resolve "Discouraged access" warnings

Access rules assure that restricted API ist not used accidently. But sometimes we need to access API that is not public
for downstream plugins. This is especially the case for non-final API of Xtext like Xbase.

You will see annoying warnings like these: 

Discouraged access: The type XExpression is not accessible due to restriction on required project org.eclipselabs.spray.generator.graphiti 

To resolve them we need to configure access rules. Open the Java Build Path, go to the Libraries folder and open the "Plug-in Dependencies tree". Then select "Access Rules" and press Edit.

Add a rule with resolution "Accessible" for pattern "org/eclipse/xtext/xbase/**" (or the package you need).
