h1. Issue Tracking

h2. Tracking System

We use the Issue Tracking System from Google Code: "http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/issues/list":http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/issues/list

p. 

For keeping up to date with incoming new issues resp. changes to existing issues each developer should subscribe to the "RSS feed":http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/feeds/p/spray/issueupdates/basic  

h2. Git Commit Message

The tracking system allows automated linking of commits to the Git Repository with the Issue Tickets when following name conventions. When fixing an issue use a commit message with this format

bc. fixed issue#<issuenumber>: <message> 

Google Code will link the commit in the issue and set it to status Fixed.
