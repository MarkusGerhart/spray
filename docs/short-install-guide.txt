A _very_ short introduction on how to install spray and run the example.

  1. Install Eclipse Indigo classic IDE.

  2. Install new software
     - EMF, Xtext2, MWE2, GEF, Graphiti

  3. Import all plugins from the plugins and from the examples directories fro the respository

  4. In the example project, look into the 'model' directory.
     - you need to chnage the path in the spray file and the properties file to freflect your situation.

  5.  Run org.xspray.xtext.generator.Main with the full pathname of the spray model file as the only argument as a file URI,
      like file://C:/xspray/xspray-runtime/org.xspray.examples.one/model/mod4j-busmod.xspray

  6. This should generate the code in the location described in the .properties file
     - refresh this project and start a new Eclipse
     - in this eclipse create a project and the a new ==> Example ==> Graphiti Diagram ==> Mod4j

Note that I have only run this on my machine with fixed paths, so you might encounter some problems doing the above
