h1. Installation

h2. Install Spray

A _very_ short introduction on how to install spray.

* Install "Eclipse Kepler IDE (= Eclipse 4.3.x)":http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages. Eclipse Classic or Eclipse Modeling Tools are appropriate Eclipse packages. 
* Start a new workspace
* Open _Help / Install New Software_
* Add the Spray 3rd party dependencies Update Site and press enter
** For the latest release: "@https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-ci-targetplatform/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.repository/target/repository/@":https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-ci-targetplatform/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.repository/target/repository/
** For the latest stable build: "@https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-ci-targetplatform/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.repository/target/repository/@":https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-ci-targetplatform/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.repository/target/repository/
** *Note:* you do not need to install anything from that 3rd party update site, the URL just have to be available in the list of known update sites

* Add the Spray Update Site and press enter
** For the latest release: "@http://spray.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/git.distribution/releases@":http://spray.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/git.distribution/releases
** For the latest stable build: "@https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-assembly-build/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.updatesite/target/repository/@":https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-assembly-build/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.updatesite/target/repository/ 
* Check _Spray / Spray SDK Feature_
!images/updatesite_release.png!
* If the Eclipse distribution does not include PDE (e.g. Eclipse for Java IDE), check also _3rd Party / Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment_
The PDE version hosted at Spray requires Eclipse 4.3 to be installed.
* If the Eclipse distribution does not include the EMF SDK, check also _3rd Party / EMF - EMF Modeling Framework SDK_ (the EMF SDK is required to be able to create an EMF Generator Model)
* *Update:* For Snapshot version instead of adding the two update sites mentioned above you can now add this update site, that aggregates these update sites into one:
** "@https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-assembly-build/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.updatesite/@":https://spray.ci.cloudbees.com/job/spray-assembly-build/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/releng/org.eclipselabs.spray.updatesite/ - here only check the first node (Spray) to install 
* Start installing the features
* Restart Eclipse when asked

h2. Uninstalling Spray

Spray can be uninstalled in Eclipse by choosing _Eclipse / About Eclipse SDK / Installation Details_. Select the Spray SDK Feature und press uninstall.
