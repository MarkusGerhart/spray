# Import all plugins from the plugins and from the examples directories fro the respository
# In the example project, look into the 'model' directory.
** you need to change the path in the spray file and the properties file to freflect your situation.
# Run org.xspray.xtext.generator.Main with the full pathname of the spray model file as the only argument as a file URI, like file://C:/xspray/xspray-runtime/org.xspray.examples.one/model/mod4j-busmod.xspray]
