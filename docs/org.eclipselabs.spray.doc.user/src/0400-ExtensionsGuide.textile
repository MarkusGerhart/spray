h2. Basic extensions: Generation Gap Pattern

The code generated by Spray can be extended (and even fully overwritten) by the developer.   For this, Spray uses the Generation Gap Pattern. More specifically we use Conditional Generation 1 (with one gen folder),  as described in "Generation Gap Pattern":http://heikobehrens.net/2009/04/23/generation-gap-pattern/ by Heiko Behrens. In  short,  the concrete, empty, subclasses that are meant as extension points are generated in the src-gen folder.  When you want to extend them, you need to move the file to the src folder.  The generator will recognize whether an extension point file is in the src folder and in that case not generate it again. Read Heiko's blog for a more elaborate explanation.
