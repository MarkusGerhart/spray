h1. Introduction

The Graphiti framework is a new approach to create highly sophisticated visual 
editors on top of the GEF framework. Graphiti can easily be integrated with EMF 
as the domain modeling framework. The creation of visual editors is done in Java, 
programming against the Graphiti framework API. It is fairly simple, but yet 
repetitive, which makes it a candidate to be supported by the means of model-driven 
development.

This project aims to provide one or more Domain Specific Languages (DSL) (for 
example with Xtext) to describe Visual DSL Editors against the Graphiti runtime, 
and provide code generation (for example with Xtend2) to create the boilerplate 
code for realizing the implementation against the Graphiti framework. Potentially 
the Spray DSL can be used to generate code for other frameworks as well.

The generated code is structured in such a way that one can always extend/overwrite 
the generated code with handwritten Java to add advanced Graphiti features that are 
not supported directly by the Spray DSL.

With the help of the tools created in this project Graphiti based diagram editors 
can be created much faster and reliable than doing it purely by hand.

A short introduction to Spray can be found in the downloads section. The code is 
in early state and subject to change.
