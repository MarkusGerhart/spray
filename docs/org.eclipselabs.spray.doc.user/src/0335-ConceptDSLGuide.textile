h1. Concept of a Model Driven Graphical Editor 

Spray is providing three different kinds of DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) - Spray Core, Shape and Style - as shown in the following graphic. The first is the core language which is responsible for the mapping between meta model to shapes, styles and behavior. The second language (Shape DSL) is used to define more complex shapes and decorator of connection. All of them will be generated from a primitive set of figures like rectangles and ellipses. It also handles complex properties as their placing, sizing policy and nesting of figures. The last DSL (Style DSL) is focusing the color and format behavior of an shape. Therefore it is possible to define individual styles like CSS relates to HTML.

If any of these model is changed the model generation process is executed and Java, XML and Properties will be generated for the Graphiti Eclipse Plug-In.
