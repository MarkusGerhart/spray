h2. Shapes

A metaclass can be mapped to a shape by referencing a Shape defined with the Shapes DSL.

A shape defined with the Shape DSL can be referred to by using the @shape@ keyword.

For how to define shapes and how to pass parameters from Spray DSL to referenced shapes see the "Shape DSL Guide" later in this documentation.
