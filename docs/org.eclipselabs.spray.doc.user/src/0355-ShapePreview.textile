h2. Shape Preview

When defining new shapes you haven't to start the runtime workspace to see the changes. 

Instead you can just hover over the shape definition name after having saved the shape file:

!images/hover.png!

This hover feature is also available in spray file, where you reference the shape 
resp. connection definition:

Even in code completion when choosing which shape to use you get the preview:
