h1. Migration Notes

As development of Spray is ongoing there are changes from time to time that won't be visible to existing Spray projects. So this section lists those changes so you can decide whether to recreate the Spray project and copy the content of your old project into the new one or to apply the changes manually to your existing old project.

h2. Renamed properties file

The configuration is now expected to be in a file named spray.properties. Before this properties file was named differently. So please rename the old properties file in spray.properties. If you forget to do this renaming generation will produce some unexpected results (e.g. code is generated in the last listed project in workspace instead of the current project, see issue "240":http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/spray/issues/detail?id=240).

h2. (Re-)generation of plugin.xml

In old Spray versions it was your task to copy the plugin.xml from src-gen into the project root. Projects created by the current version of the Spray project wizard will be configured with an ANT builder that invokes the ant-update-plugin-xml.xml (also generated by the new wizard). This builder will update parts of the plugin.xml after each change in the project. The parts are marked by generation marker comments. To force a complete regeneration you can delete the plugin.xml file.
