h3. Imports

Referenced Java types and EClasses can be imported with the @import@ keyword. This allows to use simple names later in the Spray model. The imports section is at the beginning of a Spray file:

bc.. 
import BusinessDomainDsl.*
// all the rest follows here...

h3. Diagram

The beginning of a Spray model is introduced by the @diagram@ keyword, followed by an identifier for the diagram. This is the name of the diagram type specified by the Spray model, and its name will be reflected in the generated code.

The diagram name is followed by the specification of a model root element, prefixed by the keyword @for@. This is the name of the EClass that is the root element a diagram represents. All other elements on the diagram must be insertable into containment references of the model root type.

bc.. 
import BusinessDomainDsl.*
