h2. MetaClass

h3. Referencing Ecore Classes

The @class@ keyword is followed by the (qualified) name of an EClass. You can either fully qualify the name of the EClass, or you can import the EClass with an @import@ statement before and then just use its simple name.

bc. 
class BusinessDomainDsl.BusinessClass : // full qualified name

bc.. 
import BusinessDomainDsl.* // wildcard import
import BusinessDomainDsl.BusinessClass // single import

class BusinessClass : // simple name
p. 

The content assist will propose the names of all known EClasses:

h3. Ecore models the development workspace

In the likely case that you want to use a metamodel whose .ecore file is in the development workspace, it is necessary that Xtext indexes the Ecore file and its content. To enable indexing of Ecore files from the workspace, the project containing the .ecore file must have the Xtext nature enabled. If it does not have it yet (the project would have an "X" overlay image), you can configure the nature by right-clicking on the project and choose _Configure / Add Xtext Nature_.

h3. Class Icon
Following the referenced EClass name an icon representing the class can be defined with the @icon@ keyword. The path to the icon is quoted as a string.

bc. 
class BusinessClass icon "ecore/EClass.gif"

The specified path is relative to a folder named @icons/@ in your project. It is checked that the folder @icons@ exists in your project. If the specified relative path of the icon file does not exist, a warning will be raised.

The content assist can help you entering the known icon paths. It will also show the icons.

The @icon@ folder must be added to the @bin.includes@ property of the @build.properties@ file. 
If you created the project with the Spray project wizard, the @icon@ folder was already initially created and added to @build.properties@.

bc.. 
...
bin.includes = META-INF/,\
               .,\
               plugin.xml,\
               model/,\
               plugin.properties,\
               icons/
