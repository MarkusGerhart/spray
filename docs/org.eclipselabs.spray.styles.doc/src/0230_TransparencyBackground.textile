h2. Transparency and Background

bc. 
transparency = 0.95

The @transparency@ defines the visibility of the whole shape. The value is a floating value within the interval 0.00 and 1.00. The value 1.00 defines that the shape is fully visible and 0.00 describes that the whole shape is invisible. All values between 0 and 1 can be used here to define the right transparency value.

This attribute is optional and it is not required to set it. If it isn't set the default value of 1.00 (fully visible) will be taken.   
    
bc. 
background-color = white

The background-color defines the background of the shapes. All shape elements will be of this color. 

Therefore predefined color values are possible as e.g.:

* white
* very-light-gray
* light-gray
* gray
* dark-gray
* black
* red
* light-orange
* orange
* dark-orange
* yellow
* green
* light-green
* dark-green
* cyan
* light-blue
* blue
* dark-blue


If no predefined color applies to the wanted color then the RGB values can be filled. Following text sequence should be used: @RGB(RED,GREEN,BLUE)@. The values @RED,GREEN,BLUE@ are integer values between 0 and 255. 

Otherwise if a transparent background is wanted then the value @transparent@ can be used.
